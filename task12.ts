// 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
// should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let friendName:string [] = ["Adil", "Asim", "Ovais"]
console.log("my first brother name is:", friendName[0]);
console.log("my second brother name is:", friendName[1]);
console.log("my third brother name is:", friendName[2]);
