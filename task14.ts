// 14. Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to
// invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

// interface Person {
//   name: string;
//   message: string;
// }
// const guestList: Person[] = [
//   {
//     name: "Asim",
//     message:
//       "Dear Asim, I am honored to invite you to dinner. Your insights have profoundly shaped our understanding of the universe, and it would be a privilege to converse with you.",
//   },
//   {
//     name: "Ahmed",
//     message:
//       "Dear Ahmed, your words have inspired countless individuals across generations. It would be an immense pleasure to have you join us for dinner and share your wisdom.",
//   },
//   {
//     name: "Ovais",
//     message:
//       "Dear Ovais, your brilliance as an artist, scientist, and inventor continues to amaze the world. We would be delighted if you could grace us with your presence at dinner.",
//   },
// ];

// function sendInvitations(guestList: Person[]) {
//   guestList.forEach((person) => {
//     console.log(`Sending invitation to ${person.name}...`);
//     console.log(
//       `Dear ${person.name},\n${person.message}\n\nSincerely,\n[Uzair Ahmed]`
