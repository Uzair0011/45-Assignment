// 15. Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the
// dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of
// someone else to invite.

//  Add a print statement at the
// end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.

// let namesOfGuest: string[] = [
//     "Asim", "Ahmed", "Ovais","Abdullah"
// ];
// console.log(namesOfGuest);
// let canNotAttend : string = "Asim"
// console.log(`${canNotAttend} "can not attent the dinner."`)

// // • Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with
// // the name of the new person you are inviting.

// let newGuest: string = "Abdul samad"
// namesOfGuest [namesOfGuest.indexOf(canNotAttend)] = newGuest;
// console.log(namesOfGuest)

// // • Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still
// // in your list.

// namesOfGuest.map((items)=>
// console.log(`Dear ${items} you are invited to Dinner`))
